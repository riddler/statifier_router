# Quality configuration for statifier_router.
#
#   mix quality                 - full gate: format, compile, credo, dialyzer,
#                                 deps audit, full test suite with coverage.
#                                 Run before every commit.
#
#   mix quality --profile loop  - inner loop while implementing: skips dialyzer
#                                 and coverage, runs only the tests covering
#                                 changed code. Use between edits.
#
# Agents: prefer `--format json --report -` when you want to route on results.
#
# Copied from statifier_persistence's gate, and deliberately smaller than
# statifier-ex's. That repo's custom stages - the gate guard, the ADR guard
# and judge, the regression ratchet - exist to protect a conformance corpus
# and an accepted ADR set this package does not have yet. Adopting any of
# them here is a decision to record when there is something for it to
# protect, not a default to inherit.
#
# There is deliberately no .credo.exs either: credo's own defaults under
# --strict are the gate until this package has a reason to deviate from one.

  # a finding, so unformatted code would pass instead of going red. Drift
  # fails the stage; run `mix format` yourself before committing.
