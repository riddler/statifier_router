# Changelog fragments

Changelog entries for unreleased work live here as one file per issue, not as
edits to `CHANGELOG.md`. At release the fragments are assembled into a single
version section and deleted.

## Why fragments

Parallel work happens in one worktree per issue (`parallelism.model` in
`.claude/wurk.json`), so several branches are usually open at once. If each
branch appended to the `## [Unreleased]` block at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`,
every branch would touch the same few lines of the same file and nearly every
pull request would conflict with every other one.

A fragment is named after its issue, so no two branches ever write the same file
and the conflict cannot happen.

## When a change needs a fragment

The changelog serves **people who use the library**. Repo history is git's job,
and work tracking is beads' job. Neither belongs here.

Write a fragment for:

- a public API addition, change, or removal
- a change in observable behavior
- a bug fix a user could have noticed
- anything breaking

Do **not** write a fragment for:

- test harness or test support changes with no public surface
- documentation, ADRs, or plans
- internal refactors with no visible effect
- quality gate, CI, or agent tooling changes

If you are unsure, ask whether someone who only ever calls the public API could
tell the difference. If not, skip it.

## Format

One file per issue, named for the beads issue ID:

    changelog.d/sr-abc.md

Contents are the Keep a Changelog section heading followed by the entry:

```markdown
### Changed

- `StatifierRouter.Binding.new/1` returns `{:error, reason}` for a binding
  whose key program does not compile, instead of raising.
```

Rules:

- Use only the standard headings: `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`,
  `Fixed`, `Security`.
- One line per change, present tense, describing the effect on the user.
- No nested bullets. Detail belongs in the pull request and the commit body; a
  changelog line that needs sub-points is really several changes or one that is
  over-explained.
- One file may carry more than one heading if an issue genuinely spans them.
- For a breaking change, say what to do about it, not just what broke.

Good:

```markdown
### Removed

- Drops `StatifierRouter.Binding.validate/1`. Invalid bindings now arrive
  as `{:error, reason}` from `StatifierRouter.Binding.new/1`.
```

Too much:

```markdown
### Removed

- **Validator removal**: The validator function has been removed
  - **Rationale**: Validation is now part of loading
  - **Impact**: Callers must handle `{:error, reason}`
  - **Migration**: Replace calls to ...
```

## At release

Assemble the fragments into a new version section in `CHANGELOG.md`, grouped by
heading and ordered `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`,
`Security`. Move the README's install-snippet requirement to the new release
line - it is the one user-facing version string outside `mix.exs` (operator
ruling, 2026-09-01). Delete the fragments in the same commit that cuts the
release, and tag it.
