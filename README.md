> **Pre-1.0.** Until `statifier_router` reaches v1.0, its public surface may change
> between minor releases, sometimes drastically: a release may rename modules,
> callbacks, table columns, telemetry events or error vocabulary with no
> compatibility shim. Every such change is recorded in
> [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) under a bold **Breaking** heading that says what
> to do about it. Pinning to an exact minor - `~> X.Y.0` - is the recommended way
> to consume the package until 1.0.

## Broadway first

The front of this package is [Broadway](https://hexdocs.pm/broadway). The host
starts `StatifierRouter.Broadway` in its own supervision tree with any
producer it already operates, and `partition_by` keeps every message for one key
on one processor, so the events for one key reach the router one after another
instead of queueing on a lock. The partitioner is an optimisation, not the
guarantee: each delivery steps its execution under statifier_persistence's
per-execution lock and holds that lock until its transaction commits, so two
events for one execution are stepped one at a time, in the order the lock
grants them, whether or not they came through the front. Each message is
matched against the bindings, addressed, and delivered to a durable
[statifier](https://github.com/riddler/statifier-ex) execution kept by
[statifier_persistence](https://github.com/riddler/statifier_persistence),
which is created when absent.

### Starting the pipeline

`StatifierRouter.Broadway` is the pipeline. The host adds it to its own
supervision tree, after the repo, with the producer it already operates and
the router's configuration:

```elixir
children = [
  MyApp.Repo,
  {StatifierRouter.Broadway,
   name: MyApp.AdEventsRouter,
   producer: {BroadwayKafka.Producer, kafka_opts},
   router: router_config,
   processors: [default: [concurrency: 8]]}
]

Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
```

`router_config` is a `%StatifierRouter.Config{}`. By default each message's
`scope`, `message_id` and `source` are read from its metadata and its data is
the normalized event; a producer that carries them elsewhere is paired with a
`:normalize` function of the host's own. A message whose routing returns an
error, or raises, is failed rather than acknowledged, so the source hands it
over again. A binding whose `order` is `:none` is not partitioned by its key.

## What this package owns

- **Bindings**: source -> match -> key -> document -> event. `match` and
  `key` are [predicator](https://github.com/riddler/predicator-ex) programs
  evaluated over the normalized event.
- **The address table**: `(scope, document, key)` -> `execution_id`. `scope`
  is an opaque host string; the package gives it no meaning.
- **Atomic get-or-create-and-deliver**: the execution an address names is
  created when absent and handed the event in the same step.
- **Dedupe** on `(binding, message_id)` with a horizon.
- **The recorded outcome vocabulary**: every delivery attempt ends in one
  named, recorded outcome.

## What it does not own

- Sinks and the route registry.
- Execution-to-execution sends.
- The source invoke.
- Any queue adapter: Broadway's producers are the host's choice.
- The webhook helper.
- Timers: those are [statifier_oban](https://github.com/riddler/statifier_oban)'s.
- A publish store: a host callback resolves a document to its active chart.
- Any process or supervisor: the host schedules the reapers and starts the
  pipeline.

## An example

An impression opens an execution of the `impression_click_join` document; a
click on the same impression lands on that same execution. Two bindings, one
document, one key:

```elixir
[
  %{id: "impressions_to_join", source: "ad_events",
    match: ~s(event.kind == "impression"), key: "event.impression_id",
    document: "impression_click_join", event: "impression.served"},
  %{id: "clicks_to_join", source: "ad_events",
    match: ~s(event.kind == "click"), key: "event.impression_id",
    document: "impression_click_join", event: "click.recorded"}
]
```

The shape is illustrative: the binding's fields are fixed by the package's
first decision record, not by this README.

## Status

This release is the skeleton. Of the pieces named above the binding is built,
as `StatifierRouter.Binding`, and so are the tables behind the rest: the
address table, the dedupe table and the routing ledger, created by
`StatifierRouter.Migrations` and read through the schemas in
`StatifierRouter.Schema`. `StatifierRouter.route/3` evaluates the bindings
for an event and writes the ledger row of a refusal, and
`StatifierRouter.Delivery`, its default delivery module, gets or creates the
execution an address names and steps the event into it in one transaction, for
bindings whose `create` is `:if_absent`. Nothing writes the dedupe table yet.
Each piece lands behind the decision record that fixes it, in
[docs/adr/](docs/adr/README.md).
